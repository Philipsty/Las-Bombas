# Las-Bombas
Las Bombas has one main objective, stay alive as long as possible!  It  will have a classic pixel art style that will be perfect for ages young and old. When the user plays Las Bombas they will be introduced to a loading screen ,followed by a start button screen . After the start button has been pressed, the user will be given a choice of two different characters to use. After the avatar has been chosen the game will commence!  The user will have three lives and will use the left and right arrow keys to dodge falling bombs. For every row of bombs dodged the user will gain ten score points (the score and lives will be shown at the top left of the window). I will now begin to clarify Las Bombas’s difficulty levels. In Las Bombas, it will not be easy to dodge the bombs. The difficulty will increase as the user progresses in the game. The speed of the bombs increases as more bombs are dodged, once the maximum speed is reached another bomb will be added to the row of bombs falling .When the user begins the game ,one bomb will fall  for each row and for every fifty points(every five bombs dodged), the speed will increase . This will continue until the bomb reaches a maximum speed , then another bomb will be added to the row and the speed will reset. The maximum number of bombs falling in a row will be four. Once four bombs are in a row , the speed will continue to increase until the user’s character dies.
